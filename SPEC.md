# Agent Backend Specification

This document is the language-agnostic source of truth for the Agent Backend client library API. All client implementations (TypeScript, Python, etc.) MUST conform to the behavioral contracts described here.

Implementations SHOULD use idiomatic patterns for their language (e.g., Python may use `async with` for lifecycle, TypeScript may use `await destroy()`). The exact method names, parameter ordering, and error handling idioms are left to each implementation, but the semantics described here MUST be preserved.

## Terminology

The key words MUST, MUST NOT, SHOULD, SHOULD NOT, and MAY are used as described in [RFC 2119](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2119).

**Backend** -- A client-side object that provides file operations, command execution, and MCP tool access against a workspace (local directory or remote server).

**Workspace** -- The root directory a backend operates within. All paths are relative to this root.

**Scope** -- A restricted view of a backend, rooted at a subdirectory of the parent's workspace. Used for multi-tenant isolation.

**agentbe-daemon** -- The server process that runs on a host and serves the workspace via MCP and optionally SSH.

# Client Libraries

## Backend Types

### Filesystem Backend (Local)

Operates directly on the local filesystem using OS-level APIs. Status is always "connected" until destroyed.

Configuration:
- Workspace root directory (required)
- Isolation mode (auto, bwrap, software, none)
- Whether to block dangerous commands (default: true)
- Maximum output length for command execution
- Shell preference (bash, sh, auto)

### Filesystem Backend (Remote)

Same operations as local, but executed on a remote host via SSH (for file ops) and MCP over HTTP (for tool calls). Requires explicit connection and supports reconnection.

Configuration:
- Workspace root directory on the remote host (required)
- Remote host (required)
- Transport type: SSH-over-WebSocket (default) or conventional SSH
- Authentication credentials (password or key-based for SSH; token for WebSocket)
- MCP server port
- Reconnection settings (max retries, backoff)
- Operation timeout
- Keepalive interval

### Memory Backend

In-memory key/value store. Keys act as pseudo file paths. Does NOT support command execution.

Configuration:
- Root prefix (optional, default "/")
- Initial data to pre-populate the store

---

## Connection Lifecycle

Backends have a status that reflects their connection state.

### Status Values

- **connected** -- Normal operating state.
- **connecting** -- Initial connection in progress.
- **disconnected** -- No active connection (remote only).
- **reconnecting** -- Retrying after connection loss (remote only).
- **destroyed** -- Backend has been torn down. No further operations allowed.

### Behavior by Backend Type

**Local filesystem:**
- MUST start in "connected" status.
- MUST transition to "destroyed" on destroy.
- MUST NOT have any other status transitions.

**Remote filesystem:**
- MUST start in "disconnected" status.
- MUST transition to "connecting" on first operation or explicit connect call.
- MUST transition to "connected" on successful connection.
- SHOULD attempt reconnection on connection loss if reconnection is enabled.
- MUST transition to "reconnecting" during retry attempts.
- MUST transition to "destroyed" on destroy.
- MUST reject all pending operations when connection is lost.

**Memory:**
- MUST start in "connected" status.
- MUST transition to "destroyed" on destroy.

### Status Observation

Implementations MUST provide a way to subscribe to status changes. Callbacks MUST fire on every status transition.

---

## Destroy / Resource Cleanup

Every backend MUST provide a destroy operation that tears down all resources.

### Behavior

- MUST close all MCP clients and transports created via the backend's MCP integration methods.
- MUST close all resources registered via the closeable tracking mechanism (see below).
- MUST set status to "destroyed".
- SHOULD be idempotent (calling destroy twice MUST NOT throw).
- For remote backends: MUST cancel any pending reconnection attempts, reject all pending operations, and close SSH/WebSocket connections.
- MUST NOT destroy child scoped backends automatically. Children become orphaned when the parent is destroyed.

### Closeable Tracking

Backends MUST provide a way to register external closeable resources (objects with a close method). These resources MUST be closed when the backend is destroyed. This is used internally for MCP clients and transports, and MAY be used by consumers for their own resources.

---

## File Operations

All file-based backends (local, remote, and memory) MUST support the following operations. Paths are always relative to the backend's workspace root unless otherwise noted.

### Path Resolution

- Relative paths MUST be resolved against the workspace root.
- Absolute paths that match the workspace root MUST be used directly.
- Absolute paths that do NOT match the workspace root MUST be treated as relative (leading slash stripped).
- Paths containing `..` that would escape the workspace MUST be rejected with a path escape error.
- These rules apply at every scope level for scoped backends.

### read(path)

Read the contents of a file.

- MUST return file contents as text (default) or raw bytes.
- MUST throw if the file does not exist.
- Implementations SHOULD support an encoding option to choose between text and binary output.

### write(path, content)

Write content to a file, creating or overwriting it.

- MUST accept text or binary content.
- MUST create parent directories automatically if they do not exist.
- MUST throw on write failure.

### readdir(path)

List the immediate children of a directory.

- MUST return a list of entry names (not full paths).
- For memory backends: MUST simulate directory listing via prefix matching on keys, returning only immediate children (first path segment after the prefix).

### mkdir(path)

Create a directory.

- MUST support recursive creation (create intermediate directories).
- For memory backends: MUST be a no-op (directories are implicit in key structure).

### exists(path)

Check whether a file or directory exists.

- MUST return a boolean.
- MUST NOT throw if the path does not exist.

### stat(path)

Get metadata about a file or directory.

- MUST return at minimum: whether it is a file or directory, size in bytes, and modification timestamp.
- For memory backends: MUST return synthetic stats based on the stored value.

### rm(path)

Delete a file or directory.

- MUST support a recursive option for deleting directories and their contents.
- MUST support a force option that suppresses errors when the target does not exist.
- For memory backends with recursive mode: MUST delete the exact key and all keys sharing the prefix.

### rename(oldPath, newPath)

Move or rename a file.

- Both paths MUST be validated against the workspace boundary.

### touch(path)

Create an empty file if it does not exist.

- MUST NOT overwrite existing files.
- For memory backends: MUST create the key with an empty value if it does not exist.

---

## Command Execution

### exec(command)

Execute a shell command within the workspace.

- MUST run the command in a shell (bash preferred, sh as fallback).
- MUST set the working directory to the workspace root (or the scope root for scoped backends).
- MUST set the HOME environment variable to the working directory.
- MUST return the command's standard output as text (default) or raw bytes.
- MUST throw if the command exits with a non-zero exit code. The error SHOULD include stderr (or stdout if stderr is empty).
- Implementations SHOULD support an encoding option (text vs binary output).
- Implementations SHOULD support a custom working directory option, validated to be within the workspace.
- Implementations SHOULD support custom environment variables per invocation.
- Memory backends MUST throw a not-implemented error.

### Output Limits

If a maximum output length is configured:
- MUST truncate output that exceeds the limit.
- SHOULD append a message indicating truncation occurred and the original output length.

### Safety Validation

When dangerous command blocking is enabled (default):
- MUST check commands against known dangerous patterns before execution.
- MUST reject dangerous commands with an appropriate error.
- See [Command Safety](#command-safety) for the full list of blocked patterns.

### Isolation

Implementations SHOULD support isolation modes for sandboxing command execution:

- **auto** -- Detect the best available isolation method.
- **bwrap** (Linux) -- Namespace isolation via bubblewrap. The workspace is mounted read-write; system paths are mounted read-only. Network access is preserved.
- **software** -- Heuristic-based command and path validation only.
- **none** -- No isolation. Trust mode for controlled environments.

---

## Scoping

Scoping creates a restricted sub-backend rooted at a subdirectory of the parent workspace. This is the primary mechanism for multi-tenant isolation.

### Creating a Scope

- MUST accept a relative path within the parent workspace.
- MUST validate that the scope path does not escape the parent workspace.
- MAY accept custom environment variables that apply to all commands executed within the scope.
- MAY accept an operations logger for the scope.

### Scoped Backend Behavior

- All file operations MUST be translated to the parent's path space by prepending the scope path.
- exec() MUST set the working directory to the scope's root directory.
- Environment variables MUST be merged: scope env as base, per-command env as override.
- Path validation MUST be applied at the scope level. Paths that escape the scope MUST be rejected, even if they would be valid within the parent.
- The scope's status MUST be inherited from the parent dynamically (via getter, not copied at construction time).
- Scoped backends MUST delegate closeable tracking to the root backend.
- On first write operation, the scope MUST ensure its root directory exists (create if needed). This MUST be deduped to prevent concurrent creation.

### Nested Scoping

- Scopes MUST support creating child scopes.
- Paths combine: the child's scope path is joined with the parent scope's path.
- Environment variables merge at each level (deeper scopes override shallower ones).

### Scope Destruction

- Destroying a scoped backend MUST notify the parent so it can unregister the child.
- Destroying a scoped backend MUST NOT destroy the parent.
- Scoped backends perform no resource cleanup themselves (that is the parent's responsibility).

---

## MCP Integration

Backends MUST provide a way to obtain an MCP (Model Context Protocol) client or transport for exposing workspace tools to AI agents.

### MCP Transport

- MUST return a transport suitable for connecting to an MCP server that operates on the backend's workspace.
- For local and memory backends: MUST spawn the `agent-backend daemon` CLI as a subprocess (stdio transport).
- For remote backends: MUST create an HTTP transport pointing at the remote MCP server.
- MAY accept a scope path to restrict the MCP server's workspace.
- The returned transport MUST be tracked for automatic cleanup on destroy.

### MCP Client

- MUST return a connected MCP client wrapping the transport.
- The client MUST be tracked for automatic cleanup on destroy.
- For local backends: the CLI is spawned with appropriate flags (root directory, isolation mode, shell, local-only).
- For remote backends: the client connects to the remote host's MCP server with authentication.

### MCP Server Tools

When a backend is served via MCP (through the agentbe-daemon), the following tools MUST be registered:

**File reading:**
- Read a text file (with optional head/tail line limits)
- Read a media file as base64
- Read multiple files at once

**File writing:**
- Write/overwrite a file
- Edit a file with selective replacements (with optional dry-run mode)

**Directory operations:**
- Create a directory (recursive)
- List directory contents (with file/directory type indicators)
- List directory with file sizes and stats
- Directory tree (recursive JSON structure with configurable exclude patterns)

**File management:**
- Move/rename a file
- Search for files by glob pattern
- Get detailed file metadata
- List the workspace boundary (allowed directories)

**Execution:**
- Execute a shell command (only registered if the backend supports execution)

---

## Connection Pooling

A pool manager provides backend reuse for stateless servers (e.g., web servers handling many requests).

### Key-Based Pooling

- MUST maintain at most one backend instance per key.
- If a backend for a given key exists and is connected, MUST reuse it.
- If a backend for a given key does not exist or is not connected, MUST create a new one.
- Requests without a key MUST create a fresh (non-pooled) backend each time.

### Acquisition and Release

- MUST support both explicit acquire/release and a callback pattern (execute a function with automatic release).
- Acquiring MUST increment a usage counter; releasing MUST decrement it.
- The callback pattern MUST release the backend even if the function throws.

### Idle Cleanup

- Backends with zero active usage that exceed the idle timeout MUST be eligible for cleanup.
- Cleanup MUST call destroy on idle backends and remove them from the pool.
- Periodic cleanup MAY be enabled via configuration.

### Configuration Override

- Per-request configuration overrides MUST be supported.
- Overrides are merged with the pool's default configuration (override values take precedence).

### Statistics

- MUST expose pool stats: total backends, active (in-use) backends, idle backends.

---

## Error Handling

Implementations MUST define error types that distinguish between the following failure modes:

### Backend Error (base)

General backend operation failure. MUST include:
- An error code string identifying the failure type
- A human-readable message
- Optionally, the operation that failed

### Dangerous Operation Error

Thrown when a command is blocked by safety validation.
- MUST include the command that was blocked.

### Path Escape Error

Thrown when a path resolves outside the workspace or scope boundary.
- MUST include the offending path.

### Not Implemented Error

Thrown when an operation is not supported by the backend type (e.g., exec on memory backend).
- MUST include the operation name and backend type.

### Error Codes

Implementations SHOULD use consistent error codes across backends:

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| EMPTY_COMMAND | Empty command string passed to exec |
| UNSAFE_COMMAND | Command failed safety check |
| EXEC_FAILED | Command exited with non-zero status |
| EXEC_ERROR | Command could not be spawned |
| READ_FAILED | File read failed |
| WRITE_FAILED | File write failed |
| LS_FAILED | Directory listing failed |
| PATH_ESCAPE_ATTEMPT | Path escapes workspace boundary |
| MISSING_UTILITIES | Required system tool not found |
| INVALID_CONFIGURATION | Configuration validation failed |
| DANGEROUS_OPERATION | Dangerous command blocked |
| CONNECTION_CLOSED | Connection lost (remote) |
| KEY_NOT_FOUND | Key does not exist (memory) |

---

## Command Safety

When dangerous command blocking is enabled, the following patterns MUST be rejected.

### Destructive Operations
- Recursive force deletion from root or home (`rm -rf /`, `rm -rf ~`)
- Disk overwrite (`dd of=/dev/...`)
- Filesystem formatting (`mkfs`)
- Fork bombs

### Privilege Escalation
- `sudo`, `su`, `doas`

### Shell Injection
- Command separators (`;`)
- Command chaining (`&&`, `||`)
- Command substitution (backticks, `$()`)
- Pipe to shell (`| sh`, `| bash`)

### Remote Code Execution
- Download-and-execute (`curl ... | sh`, `wget ... | bash`)
- `eval`

### Network Tampering
- Firewall modification (`iptables`)
- Network configuration changes (`ifconfig`)

### System Modification
- Broad permission changes (`chmod 777`)
- Ownership changes (`chown root`)

### Workspace Escape
- Directory change commands (`cd`, `pushd`, `popd`)
- Environment variable manipulation (`export PATH=`, `export HOME=`)
- Home directory references (`~/`, `$HOME`)
- Parent directory traversal (`../`)

### Exceptions

- Heredoc content MUST be stripped before safety validation to prevent false positives.
- Implementations MAY define allowed patterns that override specific blocked patterns (e.g., `gcloud rsync` is not the same as the `rsync` binary).

---

## Operations Logging

Backends MAY support pluggable operations logging for audit and debugging.

### Log Entries

Each log entry MUST include:
- Timestamp
- Operation type (exec, read, write, mkdir, etc.)
- Whether the operation succeeded
- Duration

Log entries SHOULD include (when applicable):
- The command or path involved
- User/workspace context
- stdout/stderr for exec operations
- Error details on failure

### Logging Modes

- **standard** -- Log only modifying operations (exec, write, mkdir, delete, touch).
- **verbose** -- Log all operations including reads.

---

## Adapters

### Vercel AI SDK Adapter

Implementations MAY provide an adapter for the Vercel AI SDK that wraps a backend and exposes its MCP tools in the format expected by the AI SDK.

- The adapter MUST create the appropriate MCP transport based on the backend type (stdio for local/memory, HTTP for remote).
- The adapter MUST return a Vercel AI SDK-compatible MCP client.
- The adapter's resources MUST be tracked by the backend for cleanup on destroy.
